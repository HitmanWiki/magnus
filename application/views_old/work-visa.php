                       Canada is a prime destination for many foreign nationals who are seeking employment opportunities. The country boasts a strong and diverse economy with a high-standard of workplace safety, competitive wages, and many opportunities for professional growth and development. In addition to this, working in Canada is an excellent first step for those seeking to immigrate to the country permanently.</p>

<h5>TYPES OF CANADIAN WORK PERMITS</h5>
<p>There are many different options for obtaining a Canadian work permit. Some work permits require a job offer from a Canadian employer, some require that the employer provide a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), while others require that a person has some sort of connection to Canada (previous education, spousal sponsorship, etc.). Please refer to the categories below to determine the work permit which best suits your qualifications: Requiring a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA)</p>

<b>Immigration Tip:</b> Canadian permanent residents do not require a work permit to work in Canada. Permanent resident status gives a person the legal right to live and work anywhere in the country. Find out more about permanent immigration options for professional and skilled workers.</p>

<h5 class="txt-list pt-3">HOW TO OBTAIN A CANADIAN WORK PERMIT</h5>
<p>
The process for obtaining a Canadian work permit varies greatly depending on which type of work permit a person is applying. For example, an international student studying in Canada will oftentimes be automatically issued authorization to work part-time as part of their study permit authorization.</p>
<p>
Most closed work permit applications require that a foreign national has an official job offer from a Canadian employer which is supported by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). Even those who are LMIA-exempt or exempt from requiring a work permit should be aware of the unique documentation they need to prepare in order to ensure they are granted entry to Canada. There are two general pathways for obtaining a Canadian work permit: a closed work permit and an open work permit.</p>
<p>
Closed work permits are tied to specific employers, this means that a foreign national issued a closed work permit must remain working with the same employer at the same location unless they change their work permit.</p>

<p>There are two types of Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) applications: a regular LMIA and a simplified LMIA. The simplified LMIA is only available in the province of Quebec. The regular LMIA is processed on a case-by-case basis with processing times varying greatly from applicant to applicant. Generally, it takes a minimum of five months to receive a response on a regular LMIA application.</p>
<p>
If an employer is eligible for Canada’s Global Talent Stream, they may qualify for expedited LMIA processing. The simplified LMIA completed for Quebec employment is usually processed in approximately two to three months.></p>

<p>It is impossible to give a rate of success for work permit/LMIA applications, as all applications are processed on a case-by-case basis. If an applicant meets the requirements of the LMIA, their application should be approved. However, applications are assessed by individual officers, each exercising their own discretion in choosing whether or not to approve a work permit application.</p>
