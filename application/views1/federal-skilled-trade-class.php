												<p>The FSTC is one of three federal economic programs managed by the Government of Canada’s Express Entry system. This means that in order to begin the process of immigrating to Canada as a tradesperson, you must first create an online Express Entry profile and obtain a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score.</p>
												<p>

The CRS determines your ranking in the Express Entry pool based on factors like skills, work experience, language ability, education and others. FSTC candidates may have lower CRS scores than other candidates in the Express Entry pool because they are not required to prove their level of education.</p>
<p>

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), however, has held program-specific draws where FSTC candidates with CRS scores as low as 199 were prioritized. See a complete overview of Express Entry draws that have taken place so far.</p>
