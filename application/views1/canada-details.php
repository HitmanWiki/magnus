												<p>Canada is a North American country consisting of ten provinces and three territories. Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west and northward into the Arctic Ocean. It is the world's second largest country by total area. Canada's common border with the United States to the south and northwest is the longest in the world.

<p>Canadians place great importance on learning, and have developed a first-rate education system with high standards. Canada offers many advantages to the international student. Canada has an excellent reputation around the world, and provides a safe, multicultural environment for anyone to study. Canadian educational institutions are internationally known for their quality, and Canadian certifications are accepted world-wide. Comparatively low tuition makes Canadian education an excellent value.</p>
<p>
Canadian teenagers consistently rank among the best in the world on international tests of reading, science and math – a testament to the outstanding quality of Canadian schools. A Canadian degree, diploma or certificate is well-regarded in business, government and academic circles around the globe.
</p>
<p>
Students who come to Canada will witness one of the most beautiful, natural environments in the world. Canada is also a country of diverse geography, and there is much to experience in its great outdoors: from the lush coastline of British Columbia, the majestic Rocky Mountains of Alberta, the big skies of the prairies, to the ‘maple sugar country’ in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence and the rugged hills and picturesque coastline of the Atlantic provinces.</p>
<p>
Canada is considered to be a relatively peaceful, safe and orderly country. Its violent crime rate decreased for ten consecutive years from 1993 to 2003. Unlike its US neighbours to the south, firearms are strictly controlled and generally are not permitted. International students who come to Canada should follow the same common sense safety precautions as they would anywhere in the world. Students can contact any Canadian Education Centre to learn more about personal safety, or attend a safety orientation session at their school upon their arrival in Canada.</p>

											 <p>Most of the Canadian universities and other higher educational Institutions have their own application guidelines and deadlines. Overseas students are therefore advised to start the application procedures well in advance. Once students decide the institution(s) that they are interested in, they are advised to write directly to them to receive the application procedure and detailed requirements for acceptance. It is also good to inquire about scholarships and other financial aid details and staying facilities. Students should apply for a student authorization at the nearest Canadian diplomatic mission after being accepted by an institution for a program of study in Canada.</p>
                                   
                                  <h5 class="h5-md darkblue-color">  In order to apply for a student authorization, overseas students need the following documents:</h5>
									<!-- List -->
									<ul class="txt-list">
												
										<li>A valid passport.</li>
										<li>Letter of acceptance from the respective Canadian University, college or other institution where the student is enrolled.</li>
										<li>Evidence of adequate funds to cover tuition and living costs of students and their dependents (if any), including return transportation.</li>
										<li>In some cases, a medical examination by a doctor designated by the Canadian government may be needed. The immigration officer will provide information about this requirement</li>
