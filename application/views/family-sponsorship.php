                       Many citizens in Canada & permanent residents have their relatives outside Canada, whom they wish to bring to Canada. The government of Canada offers the privilege to such citizens under the segment of Family Class Sponsorship. The Family Class Sponsorship Program is one of the most suitable and liberal programs that are incorporated into the immigration process by the Canadian government. Through this program, the Canadian government tries to keep loved ones and families together & unified whenever possible.</p>

		             <h5 > Are you a Canadian citizen or Permanent Resident? Is 
                     your spouse, common law or conjugal partner, or dependent child a non-citizen?
                      At Cougar Immigration we can assist you in sponsorship of your family member!
                      </h5>

   <p>Canadian citizens and permanent residents can sponsor their spouse (including common-law or 
   conjugal partner), or dependent child to immigrate to Canada as a permanent resident. 
   Both the sponsor and the sponsored person must meet certain requirements to qualify.</p>

<h5 >Who can sponsor?</h5>

<p>Only Canadian citizens, permanent residents can sponsor their spouse or dependent child/ren.
 Temporary residents, including individuals with applications for permanent residence in process,
  are not eligible to sponsor their family members. Individuals who received permanent residence 
  as a result of being sponsored by their spouse or partner are only eligible to sponsor if they
   became a permanent resident more than 5 years ago. In situations when marriages fail and 
   individuals divorce (following a spousal sponsorship), sponsors wishing to sponsor another 
   spouse must wait 3 years from the date the previous spouse became a permanent resident.</p>

<p>Sponsors must be 18 years of age or older, cannot be subject to a removal order, or be in prison,
 and cannot be in receipt of social assistance (excluding disability). 
 Sponsors must also have no outstanding sponsorship undertakings, immigration or court 
 order debts, or undischarged bankruptcies. Individuals who were convicted of attempting,
  threatening to commit or committing a violent offence, of any offence against a family member, 
  or of any sexual offence (either inside or outside of Canada) may not be eligible to act as a
   sponsor.</p>

<p>Canadian citizens can sponsor while residing outside of Canada, while the permanent residents
 must reside in Canada.</p>

<h5>Undertaking and Sponsorship Agreement</h5>

<p>As part of the sponsorship application, sponsors must include a signed undertaking and a
 sponsorship agreement. The undertaking commits the sponsor to providing financial support
  for the basic needs of the individual being sponsored for a period of time. This period of 
  time varies depending on the age of the individual sponsored, their relationship to the sponsor
   and their place of settlement in Canada. For instance, sponsorship undertaking for a spouse is
    3 years, for a child could be up to 10 years. Sponsors are also committing to repay any 
    provincial social assistance received by the sponsored family member during the period of time 
    of the undertaking. The undertaking is binding regardless of a change in the sponsors situation
     or in their relationship with the applicant.</p>

<p>Generally, income requirements are not imposed on individuals who seek to sponsor their spouse,
 partner or dependent child. However, sponsors must be able to financially support the sponsored 
 persons or make suitable arrangements for their support. Sponsors must only demonstrate that they
  meet certain income requirements if:</p>

<ol>
<li>they are sponsoring a dependent child who has 1 or more dependent children; or</li>
<li>they are sponsoring a spouse or partner with a dependent child who has 1 or more dependent children. Sponsors who fall within one of these categories must submit a Financial Evaluation form with the sponsorship application.
Please note that sponsors residing in Quebec are subject to different immigration sponsorship 
requirements. These sponsors are first assessed (and must be approved) by Immigration, Refugees
 and Citizenship Canada and then by the province of Quebec. An undertaking is also specifically
  signed with the province of Quebec.</li>
  </ol>
<h5>
Who can apply as a sponsored person?</h5>
<p>
Spouses and partners who apply for permanent residence as a member of the family class must be at
 least 18 years of age and must not be inadmissible to Canada. Additionally:</p>

<ul class="txt-list">
<li>Spouses must be legally married to the sponsor</li>
<li>Common law partners must have been living with the sponsor for at least 12 consecutive months in 
a marriage-like relationship</li>
<li>Conjugal partners must have been in a relationship with the sponsor for at least 1 year and 
must be unable to either live with or marry their sponsor because of significant legal and
 immigration reasons (ie: where same sex relationships are illegal, conjugal partners would be
  unable to marry or live together).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
In the case of a dependent child, a son or daughter is considered 'dependant' if they are under 
the age of 22 and do not have a spouse or common law partner. 
Children over the age of 22 may still qualify as dependants if they are financially dependent 
on a parent due to a physical or mental condition and they have depended on their parent for 
financial support since before the age of 22. The children must be related to the sponsor by 
blood or adopted.</p>
<p>
All applicants and their dependants must go through medical, criminal screening, including the
 dependants who are not immigrating to Canada</p>

<h5>How to apply?</h5>

<p>There are two options for persons hoping to apply for permanent residence as a member of the 
family class.  A sponsor can either submit an "In-Canada" spousal sponsorship or an "overseas" 
spousal sponsorship.  Both applications have different requirements, processing times and associated 
rights and limitation.  It is therefore recommended that you obtain some legal advice to determine 
which application is right for you.</p>

<p>The documentation requirements for sponsoring a spouse, common-law partner, conjugal partner or 
dependent child also all differ.  It is therefore important to make sure that all documentation 
submitted meet the requirements of your specific case.</p>

<h4 class="darkblue-color">THE OBJECTIVE OF THE FAMILY CLASS OF IMMIGRATION IS TO REUNITE CLOSE
 FAMILY MEMBERS IN CANADA.</h4>
<p>Through the Family Class, Canadian citizens and permanent residents may sponsor their dependent 
children, parents and grandparents, spouse, common-law, and conjugal partners.</p>
<p>
The Government of Canada has a strong commitment to keeping families together whenever possible. 
Because of this, processing of Family Class applications is a high priority at Cougar Immigration 
Offices.</p>
<p>
Under most circumstances, individuals coming to Canada as temporary foreign workers or
 permanent residents have the right to bring their dependents, including any and all dependent
  children, to Canada with them. However, circumstances arise when this is not possible at the time 
  of immigration. For Canadian citizens and permanent residents with dependent children abroad, 
  the government has created a special program to facilitate their loved ones' entry into Canada.</p>

<h5>The Dependent Child Sponsorship Program</h5>

<p>Dependent children, both natural and adopted, may be sponsored to live with their parent(s) 
as permanent residents in Canada. The child sponsorship program is a subsection of the Family 
Class of immigration.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for this program, both the Canadian citizen or permanent resident 
(also called the 'sponsor') and their child abroad (the 'sponsored person') must be approved 
by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) in order for the sponsored person to
 receive a visa.</p>

<p>To receive a visa through this immigration program, the sponsor and the sponsored person will be 
required to prove their relationship to one another. Individuals whose adoption proceedings are 
in the final phases of processing may begin sponsoring their child before the adoption has been
 finalized. Be sure to read the specific requirements for the program, as well as some additional
  general requirements for Canadian sponsorship.</p>

<h5>After Sponsorship</h5>
<p>Children sponsored through the Family Class of immigration receive Canadian permanent residence. 
This includes the right to study and work in Canada.</p>

                                      AND GRANDPARENTS PROGRAM (PGP) AND/OR THE SUPER VISA PROGRAM.</h4>
<h5>Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP)</h5>
<p>Canada's Family Class sponsorship program includes a stream dedicated to parents and grandparents
 of Canadian citizens and permanent residents. Parents and grandparents approved under this program 
 receive Canadian permanent residence and may eventually be able to apply for Canadian citizenship.</p>

<p>To be eligible for Canada's Parents and Grandparents Program, an individual must meet:</p>
<ul class="txt-list">
<li>
Be a Canadian citizen, permanent resident of Canada, or a registered Indian under the Canadian Indian
 Act;</li>
<li>Be 18 years of age or older;</li>
<li>Be residing in Canada (potential applicants will need to provide a proof of status during the 
Interest to Sponsor phase);</li>
<li>Exceed the minimum necessary income level for this program (if married or in a common-law relationship,
the income of both the sponsor and spouse can be included) and provide proof of income to IRCC; and</li>
<li>Sign an undertaking
<ul class="txt-list">
<li>
to financially support the sponsored for 20 years (starting when they become permanent residents); 
and </li>
<li> to repay any social assistance benefits paid to the sponsored family members (if applicable) 
for a period of 20 years.</li>
<li>If the sponsor resides in Quebec, an additional "undertaking" must be signed with the province
 of Quebec.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
Applicants to the PGP will have to prove that they meet the minimum income requirements by submitting 
notices of assessment issued by the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) in support of their application.</p>

<h5>PGP Updates for 2019</h5>
<p>In an effort to improve the application process, IRCC replaced its controversial randomized 
application process with a "first-in, first-served" model for the 2019 in-take cycle.</p>

<p>IRCC has a 2019 quota of up to 20,000 complete applications through the PGP. Invitations to apply
 to the program will be issued based on the order Interest to Sponsor forms were received once 
 the forms are reviewed for eligibility.</p>

<p>Completing the online Interest to Sponsor Form on IRCC's website was the first step to the
 Parent and Grandparent sponsorship process.</p>

<h5>PGP 2019 Interest to Sponsor Form</h5>
<p>
Prior to submitting the Interest to Sponsor form, IRCC encourages potential sponsors to gather the required information, including proof of status in Canada.
Individuals completing the form will need to provide the following information:</p>

</ul>

submit one of the following documents as proof of status in Canada:</p>
<ul class="txt-list">
<li>Permanent resident card (both sides)</li>
<li>Record of landing (IMM 1000) (only if the interested sponsor didn't receive a PR Card)</li>
<li>Confirmation of Permanent Residence (IMM 5292 or IMM 5688)</li>
<li>Canadian Citizenship Certificate or card (both sides)</li>
<li>Canadian birth certificate
   <ul class="txt-list"><li>If the interested sponsor was born in Quebec, IRCC will only accept a
